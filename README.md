#Longest Palindrome Finder

##What is a Palindrome?
A palindrome is a line of text that can be read the same backwards or forwards.
For instance, "Taco cat" is a palindrome, provided you ignore both capitalization and spaces.
If you do not ignore those, then it would have to be "TACOCAT" or "tacocat" to be a palindrome.

##What does this program do?
This program finds the longest palindromes in a string of text and gives you both the length of the palindrome and all of the palindromes of that length within the string of text.

##Why?
Because this challenge was assigned during one of my programming job interviews, and I couldn't come up with a solution in the allotted time. Naturally, after I finished the interview, I had to go back and figure out the problem. After I did, I started adding additional features, such as the ability to ignore spaces and capitalization. I have a problem.
